  <p>This league is made up of high school friends from Newton, Iowa who have stayed connected through their shared love of football, even after they've gone their separate ways and now live in different cities.</p>
  <p>The Newton Cardinals were their high school football team's mascot and their fierce competitiveness has only intensified over the years.</p>
  <p>This league, behind our fearless Commish Andrew, gives us the opportunity to dive into strategy, camaraderie, and of course, plenty of trash talking!</p>
